Build Tool
@Author = Christopher 101112

This program is fully functioning and is comprised of:
“buildtool.c”
“buildtool.h”

Directory system “TestBuildTool” and “main.c” are included for testing purposes.

To test, simply compile buildtool.c, run the executable, and another executable named “buildtool” will be created. Use command ./buildtool to execute. Successful execution will result in lyrics of “On the Wing” by Owl City being printed.

This program works on any standard directory system.
