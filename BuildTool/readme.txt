ICSI 333 Build Tool

This is the final version, submitted to Blackboard.

This program is fully functioning and is comprised of:
“buildtool.c”
“buildtool.h”

Directory system “TestBuildTool” and “main.c” are included for testing purposes.

To test, simply compile build tool.c, run the executable, and another executable named “buildtool” will be created. Use command ./buildtool to execute. Successful execution will result in lyrics of “On the Wing” by Owl City being printed.

This program does not use pthreads.

This program works on any standard directory system.
